# Notes about the project

## May 9, 2022 meeting with Pavana

CTFR is a trans-membrane protein that maintains the pH of the duct.

When CTFR is knocked out at 3 months the pathology of the pancreas is significantly changed. The glucose regulation also changes. At first, GTTs are normal, then they are disregulated in phase II, in phase III they return to mostly normal, and then in phase 4 they are disreguated again and diabetes develops (CF related diabetes CFRD)

Why are Beta cells affected?

Some ductal cells in the KO express PDX1 and INS. Are the ducts contributing to the changes in the pancreas?

Experiment:
1. Isolate ducts, expand and differentiate
2. Perform scRNA-seq at timepoints along differentiation

Goals:
1. Can we use pseudotime to set up a developmentary trajectory?
2. What genes or pathways change in development? 
3. Are there cell types or clusters specific to the KO or WT?


Plan:
1. Meet biweekly with Pavana
2. First try alignment, see how it looks
